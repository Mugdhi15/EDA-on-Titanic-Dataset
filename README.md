# EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset
In this project, we performed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling on the Titanic dataset. Starting with cleaning the data, we addressed missing values using both statistical techniques and machine learning-based imputation (Random Forest with IterativeImputer). We then conducted univariate and bivariate analyses to understand distributions and survival trends across variables like gender, class, age, and family size. Through feature engineering, we created new meaningful features such as family_size and categorized age_group to capture hidden patterns. Advanced visualizations like heatmaps and correlation bar plots helped us uncover strong relationships between features and survival. Finally, we built predictive models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers, evaluated them using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports, and visualized feature importances to identify key drivers of survival. This end-to-end pipeline provided both actionable insights and a robust survival prediction framework.
